Import hashlib and time libraries;
input a string;
record the start time (didn't start before the input as it'll include the time taken to type the string which is irrelevant and varies with user);
start an infinite loop and check for each value of i;
the variable "result" is converted into int before comparing it with "a";
break the loop when nonce is found;
record the end time and print the difference between the end and the start time.
